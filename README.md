# Inspiro

Inspiro is a lightweight integration that helps you turn ideas into visuals.  
With a simple text prompt, Inspiro searches inspirational images from multiple sources (Pinterest + Unsplash) and saves selected images directly to your Pinterest boards.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Enter a text prompt (ex: *“Scandinavian living room, natural wood”*).  
2. Inspiro searches Pinterest first, then Unsplash if needed.  
3. Images are ranked, deduplicated, and prepared for saving.  
4. You can auto-pick or manually select which images to pin.  
5. Pins are saved directly to your chosen Pinterest board.
